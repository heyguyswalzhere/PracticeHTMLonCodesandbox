# PracticeHTMLonCodesandbox
Created with CodeSandbox
The purpose of this repo is to learn how codesandbox and github are integrated. The goal is to show students in my coding clasess how to use their Chromebooks to code on the web through codesandbox, commit that stuff to github, and then edit stuff in github or whatever.
